## Introduction
This is a simple webpage which helps you identify the gender of a name. It uses pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to function, and uses the https://api.genderize.io API to make its predictions.
The user can also manually choose a gender for the name they have specified, and save it for the later uses.

## Demo

The webpage is up and can be accessed [here](https://negarmov.github.io/Male-or-Female/). \
You can also use the webpage locally by simply opening the `index.html` file in your browser.
